NTD DHIS2 database vs HMIS?
------------

The national Health Management Information System (HMIS) is a data collection system designed to collect key health indicators from health facilities across the country on a wide range of health conditionals in order to support planning, management, and decision-making.

The NTD DHIS2 database is a data warehouse that connects to a wide range of external databases to create a single data repository of all NTD programmatic data in Ethiopia. Some data, such as the routine reporting of MDA treatments and morbidity management come through HMIS facility-based reporting. Other data, such as the event data associated with epidemiological surveys, comes through integration with global systems, such as Tropical Data, or through national systems, such as electronic data collection tools implemented by the Ethiopia Public Health Institute (EPHI). Altogether, these NTD data allow the NTD program to plan, manage, and report on NTD control and elimination programming.
